# monthlyAchievements04--22
The web should contain:
- The general field that I'm currently learning
- the specificity that is withing that field
- what percentage out of the other field did I consume
- what are the details and experience did I have
- what are some of my works
- and how long did it take me

**Features that should be implemented:**
- Menu nav that appears and disappears based on scrolling
- A big picture that displays your general work
- Menu navigator that highlights a selected category while being in that current category
- Works category that showcases all of your works of the month 
- Photo slider or something
